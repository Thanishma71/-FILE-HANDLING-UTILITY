Description: "This Java-based project is a File Handling Utility that allows users to create, read, append, modify, and delete text files through a command-line interface. It was developed to practice and demonstrate the core concepts of file handling in Java using the java.io package. This project helps users perform basic file operations without needing any graphical interface or complex setup. The primary motivation behind building this utility was to understand how file systems can be managed through programming and how to interact with files in a secure and efficient way. I used Google and ChatGPT to research file handling methods and Java syntax. These resources helped me clarify logic, improve structure, and add better error handling in the code. The development was done using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which provided a smooth coding experience, terminal integration, and Java support through extensions.

The utility begins by offering a simple menu-driven interface where the user can select from different options like creating a new file, reading a file, appending content, modifying content, or deleting a file. In the file creation option, the program first checks if the file already exists. If not, it creates a new file and then asks the user whether they want to write content into it immediately or leave it empty. This added flexibility allows users to create multiple files and choose whether to populate them right away. If the user chooses to write, the content is saved using BufferedWriter. In the read file option, the content of the selected file is displayed line by line using BufferedReader, allowing the user to preview the file before making any changes.

For appending content, the utility opens the file in append mode and writes the new data at the end, ensuring that existing content remains intact. One of the most useful features of this program is the modify option. When selected, the program first shows the current content of the file and then asks the user to choose between replacing the entire content or finding and replacing specific text. This dual option allows both complete overwriting and selective editing of data inside the file, which is handled using string manipulation methods and buffer classes.

The delete option allows users to remove unwanted files permanently. The program checks if the file exists before trying to delete it, ensuring safe operations and avoiding errors. Throughout the program, proper error handling has been implemented to manage common issues such as file not found, input/output exceptions, and invalid user inputs. All user interactions are done via the console using the Scanner class, making the tool easy to operate and understand.

By developing this utility, I gained hands-on experience with file I/O operations in Java. I also improved my skills in exception handling, user interaction, and menu-driven program design. The process of writing this program helped me understand the importance of clean code, modular design, and user-friendly features. Overall, this project not only enhanced my technical knowledge but also served as a valuable addition to my Java learning journey, making it suitable for submission in internship tasks or academic assignments."
